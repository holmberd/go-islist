# Load Elements
When saving skiplist elements to disk or another data structure, store them in descending order (greatest to smallest). When reloading, insert them into the skiplist in the same descending order.

When elements are inserted in descending order, each new element being inserted is always smaller than the previously inserted element. This means the traversal always stops at the head of the skiplist, and no further traversal is needed.

This avoids the O(log N) traversal, and the insertion completes in O(1).
